# FEVM NextJS Hardhat Kit

This repository contains the starter kit for creating a FEVM + NextJS project which can be connected and used together seemlessly.
We have also integrated the Wallaby Testnet using Rainbow Kit's Provider to help developers get up and running with developing their FVM Project as quickly as possible.

## Working on the Front End

`cd frontend`

`npm run dev`

As you can see, the starter kit comes ready-made with Ethers JS and Rainbow Kit, and all the configuration required to connect to the Wallaby Testnet
